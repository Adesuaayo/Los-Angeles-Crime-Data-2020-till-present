# Los-Angeles-Crime-Data-2020-till-present
In this project we analyze the incidence and prevalence of crime in Los Angeles 
This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020. This data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper and therefore there may be some inaccuracies within the data.
The data dictionary can be found on [**LAPD**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.lacity.org%2FPublic-Safety%2FCrime-Data-from-2020-to-Present%2F2nrs-mtv8) website.
We used Excel for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau for visualization and creating a dashboard.
The dashboard can be viewed [**here**](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2Fviews%2FCrimeDataDashboard_16816483168380%2FDashboard4%3F%3Alanguage%3Den-US%26%3Adisplay_count%3Dn%26%3Aorigin%3Dviz_share_link%26%3Adevice%3Ddesktop).
